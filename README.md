# This pipeline has moved

This pipeline has been moved to the new `nf-core` GitHub organisation. You can now
find it here:

### https://github.com/nf-core/ExoSeq

This repository will be archived to maintain the release version for future
reproducibility, to allow reruns.

If you have any questions, please get in touch: support@ngisweden.se

## Introduction

NGI-ExoSeq is a bioinformatics package that performs best-practice analysis pipeline for Exome Sequencing data at the [National Genomics Infastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)
at [SciLifeLab Stockholm](https://www.scilifelab.se/platforms/ngi/), Sweden.

The pipeline is built based on [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/) best practices using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool. The main steps done by pipeline are the following (more information about the processes can be found [here](docs/processes.md)).

* Alignment
* Marking Duplicates
* Recalibration
* Realignment
* Variant Calling
* Variant Filtration
* Variant Evaluation
* Variant Annotation

## Documentation
The NGI-ExoSeq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:

4. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)
5. [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Credits
The pipeline was initally developed by Senthilkumar Panneerselvam ([@senthil10](https://github.com/senthil10)) with a little help from Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels)) and has been adapted by Alex Peltzer ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer)) and Marie Gauder ([@mgauder](https://github.com/mgauder)) to our needs at QBiC, Tübingen, Germany.

In addition, we would like to recognise:
* Developers at [SciLifeLab](http://www.scilifelab.se/) in Stockholm, Sweden
* Developers at [National Genomics Infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/NationalGenomicsInfrastructure/people) for their help, supports and suggestions
